# The Wealthy Barber Returns


- The book is a collection of platitudes told wordily with the odd joke:

- Spend less than you make.

- Resist the urge to endlessly acquire possessions for their own sake, or for
  status' sake.

- Put time between the stimulus (lizard brain's urge to buy), and the action
  (potential purchase).

- Before making a purchase, think ahead to whether you will still enjoy the
  thing after a year or two.

- Avoid comparing yourself to wealthier people by increasing your perspective
  to include far less privileged regions (e.g., rural China, North Africa,
  etc.)

- Be grateful for what you have, compared with what previous decades had (there
  is a comment about cost of food going down as a percentage of the average
  Canadian's income -- it would be interesting to see the entire distribution
  of Canadian incomes vs. cost of food since the 1940s, since taking the mean
  is heavily skewed by outlying incomes such as the author's).
