# The Wealthy Barber Returns


- The book is a collection of platitudes told wordily with the odd joke:

- Spend less than you make.

- Resist the urge to endlessly acquire possessions for their own sake, or for
  status' sake.

- Put time between the stimulus (lizard brain's urge to buy), and the action
  (potential purchase).

- Before making a purchase, think ahead to whether you will still enjoy the
  thing after a year or two.

- Avoid comparing yourself to wealthier people by increasing your perspective
  to include far less privileged regions (e.g., rural China, North Africa,
  etc.)

- Be grateful for what you have, compared with what previous decades had (there
  is a comment about cost of food going down as a percentage of the average
  Canadian's income -- it would be interesting to see the entire distribution
  of Canadian incomes vs. cost of food since the 1940s, since taking the mean
  is heavily skewed by outlying incomes such as the author's).

- Say "I can't afford it".

- Beware of having more taste than money (the positive feedback home
  renovation).

- Leave credit and debit cards at home, and bring cash.

- Lines of credit are both convenient and insidious.

- Good debt is defined as assets that increase in value faster than their
  interest accumulates, _and_ can be paid off in full before retirement, _and_
  can be paid off while still meeting your savings goals. In other words, live
  in a house you can afford!

- Pay yourself first: save first, spend what's left.

- Pay yourself first, start now, live within your means.

- Don't look at potential inheritance as an excuse to avoid saving today.

- Track expenditures comprehensively for several months, and plot them by
  category.
  Use the feedback from this exercise to figure out how to spend "efficiently"
  in terms of "joy units" derived from your expenses.

- The latte factor: a little spending adds up, collectively.
  Use a spending summary to track this.
