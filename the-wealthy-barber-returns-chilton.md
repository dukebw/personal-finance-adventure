# The Wealthy Barber Returns


- The book is a collection of platitudes told wordily with the odd joke:

- Spend less than you make.

- Resist the urge to endlessly acquire possessions for their own sake, or for
  status' sake.

- Put time between the stimulus (lizard brain's urge to buy), and the action
  (potential purchase).

- Before making a purchase, think ahead to whether you will still enjoy the
  thing after a year or two.

- Avoid comparing yourself to wealthier people by increasing your perspective
  to include far less privileged regions (e.g., rural China, North Africa,
  etc.)

- Be grateful for what you have, compared with what previous decades had (there
  is a comment about cost of food going down as a percentage of the average
  Canadian's income -- it would be interesting to see the entire distribution
  of Canadian incomes vs. cost of food since the 1940s, since taking the mean
  is heavily skewed by outlying incomes such as the author's).

- Say "I can't afford it".

- Beware of having more taste than money (the positive feedback home
  renovation).

- Leave credit and debit cards at home, and bring cash.

- Lines of credit are both convenient and insidious.

- Good debt is defined as assets that increase in value faster than their
  interest accumulates, _and_ can be paid off in full before retirement, _and_
  can be paid off while still meeting your savings goals. In other words, live
  in a house you can afford!

- Pay yourself first: save first, spend what's left.

- Pay yourself first, start now, live within your means.

- Don't look at potential inheritance as an excuse to avoid saving today.

- Track expenditures comprehensively for several months, and plot them by
  category.
  Use the feedback from this exercise to figure out how to spend "efficiently"
  in terms of "joy units" derived from your expenses.

- The latte factor: a little spending adds up, collectively.
  Use a spending summary to track this.

- Savings amount: 15% of your gross income, assuming you start saving from 25
  and continue to 65.
  Many factors affect this, including when you want to retire, inflation,
  increasing tax rates, CPP being more stingy, etc.
  If you intend to work 30 years instead of 40, saving 30% of your gross income
  is required to match the person who started saving 10 years earlier.

- Defined-benefit plans are forced savings that is tax deductible, since this
  is part of the overall compensation package negotiated by the employee with
  their employer.

- Know your post-deductions income, and use this to convert purchaes into your
  time.

- Spend extra money on experiences, not possessions (the best things in life
  aren't things).

- The happiest people live within their means, since they understand that
  happiness is derived from inexpensive things such as social interaction.
  Whereas trying to acquire happiness by buying material goods just leads to
  disappointment and wanting to buy even more stuff.

- Two themes: simplictiy is sophistication, and human nature is an unignorable
  factor (often for the worse).

- Don't trust financial advisors who think they're clairvoyant.

- Seemingly small differences in return make exponential differences in the
  long term.

- Figure out how much you should be contributing annually to your RRSP (TFSA,
  too) and set up a pre-authorized chequing plan to have one-twelfth of that
  amount transferred monthly to your RRSP.
  Then, apply to the CRA for a tax reduction at source (to reduce your income
  tax at work) to reflect the deductible RRSP contributions.

- Go with term insurance policies until your TFSA and RRSP are maxed out, and
  your mortgage paid off.
